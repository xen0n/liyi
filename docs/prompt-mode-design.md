# `--prompt` Mode Design

**Status:** Implemented
**Target:** v0.1.x
**Design authority:** `docs/liyi-design.md` v8.10

**Scope note (v8.10):** This document covers the full `--prompt` scope: coverage gaps (Untracked, MissingRelatedEdge, ReqNoRelated) plus stale items, shifted spans, and unreviewed specs. Diagnostics are grouped by `(type, template)` so that instruction text is stated once per group rather than repeated per item.

---

## Overview

The `--prompt` flag for `liyi check` emits structured JSON listing every coverage gap with resolution instructions. Unlike the default human-readable output or the planned `--json` mode (machine-readable for CI/dashboards), `--prompt` is specifically designed for agent consumption — it includes natural-language instructions for resolving each gap.

The formal schema is at `schema/prompt.schema.json`.

## Goals

1. **Agent-consumable:** The output is structured enough for an agent to parse programmatically, but also includes human-readable instructions for context.
2. **Self-contained:** Each gap entry contains all information needed to resolve it without additional file discovery.
3. **Actionable:** Instructions are specific and actionable — "Add X to Y" not "Something is wrong."

## Non-Goals

1. Not a different check — `--prompt` uses the same detection engine as default mode, just formats output differently.
2. Not for human terminal use — the default mode remains the human-friendly output.
3. Not a replacement for `--json` — `--json` (post-MVP) will be leaner, without instruction text, for CI/dashboard consumption.

## Output Schema

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://liyi.run/schema/0.1/prompt.schema.json",
  "root": ".",

}
```

### Field Definitions

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `root` | string | No | Repository root relative to working directory (default: `"."`) |
| `security_notice` | string | Yes | Trust-level declaration: per-group `untrusted_fields` lists which item fields are untrusted; `template` is a tool-generated constant |
| `groups` | array | Yes | Diagnostics grouped by `(type, template)`. Empty when no actionable diagnostics exist |
| `groups[].type` | string | Yes | Diagnostic type shared by all items in the group |
| `groups[].template` | string | Yes | Tool-generated instruction template with `{placeholder}` tokens — fully trusted |
| `groups[].untrusted_fields` | string[] | Yes | Item field names that originate from repository source files (untrusted) |
| `groups[].count` | integer | Yes | Number of items in this group (must equal `items.length`) |
| `groups[].items` | array | Yes | Per-diagnostic data objects. Field schema depends on the group type |
| `exit_code` | integer | Yes | Exit code that `liyi check` would return (0, 1, or 2) |

**Note on non-coverage diagnostics:** Error-class diagnostics (`ParseError`, `OrphanedSource`, `SpanPastEof`, etc.) are not included in `groups`. They affect the process exit code (which is reflected in `exit_code`) but are not actionable. Agents encountering `exit_code: 2` should fall back to default output mode for error details.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Add `--prompt` CLI flag

In `crates/liyi-cli/src/cli.rs`, add to the `Check` variant:

```rust
/// Emit agent-consumable JSON output for coverage gaps
#[arg(long)]
prompt: bool,
```

Note: `--prompt` and `--json` (future) will be mutually exclusive. Add `conflicts_with = "json"` when `--json` is implemented.

### 2. Update `CheckFlags`

In `crates/liyi/src/diagnostics.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct CheckFlags {
    // ... existing fields ...
    pub prompt_mode: bool, // New: indicates --prompt was requested
}
```

Or alternatively, handle `--prompt` entirely at the CLI layer by passing a formatter enum to `run_check`.

### 3. Create prompt output types

In `crates/liyi/src/prompt.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
pub struct PromptOutput {
    #[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    pub root: Option<String>,
    pub security_notice: String,
    pub groups: Vec<PromptGroup>,
    pub exit_code: u8,
}

#[derive(Serialize)]
pub struct PromptGroup {
    #[serde(rename = "type")]
    pub prompt_type: &'static str,
    pub template: &'static str,
    pub untrusted_fields: &'static [&'static str],
    pub count: usize,
    pub items: Vec<serde_json::Value>,
}
```

### 4. Generate instructions

Each diagnostic type maps to a group identified by `(type_name, template)`. Templates are compile-time constants (trusted). Items within a group are plain JSON objects whose fields depend on the type. The group's `untrusted_fields` declares which item fields originate from repository source (untrusted).

**Grouping key:** Two diagnostics share a group when they have the same `type_name` *and* the same `template`. This matters for `stale_spec`, which has two templates — one for fixable specs (unreviewed, hash-only drift) and one for reviewed specs needing manual intent update.

### 5. Modify `run_check` to support prompt mode

Option A: Return diagnostics + optional prompt output
```rust
pub fn run_check(
    root: &Path,
    scope_paths: &[PathBuf],
    fix: bool,
    dry_run: bool,
    flags: &CheckFlags,
) -> (Vec<Diagnostic>, LiyiExitCode, Option<PromptOutput>)
```

Option B: Handle formatting at CLI layer
```rust
// In main.rs
let (diagnostics, exit_code) = liyi::check::run_check(...);

if prompt {
    let prompt_output = build_prompt_output(&diagnostics, exit_code, root);
    println!("{}", serde_json::to_string_pretty(&prompt_output).unwrap());
} else {
    // Default human-readable output
    for d in &diagnostics { ... }
}
```

Option B is cleaner — keeps formatting concerns out of the core check logic.

### 6. Build prompt output from diagnostics

`build_prompt_output` in `prompt.rs` iterates diagnostics and builds `(GroupMeta, serde_json::Value)` pairs for:
- `DiagnosticKind::Untracked` → `missing_requirement_spec`
- `DiagnosticKind::MissingRelatedEdge` → `missing_related_edge`
- `DiagnosticKind::ReqNoRelated` → `req_no_related`
- `DiagnosticKind::Stale` → `stale_spec` (two templates: fixable vs manual)
- `DiagnosticKind::Shifted` → `shifted_span`
- `DiagnosticKind::Unreviewed` → `unreviewed_spec`
- `DiagnosticKind::ReqChanged` → `req_changed`

A final `group_items()` pass groups them by `(type_name, template pointer)`, preserving insertion order. Error-class diagnostics (`ParseError`, `OrphanedSource`, etc.) are excluded from groups but still affect `exit_code`.

### 7. Exit code handling

`--prompt` output includes the exit code that would be returned. The actual process exit code is the same as default mode (respecting `--fail-on-*` flags).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `liyi check --prompt` on a fixture with gaps produces valid JSON matching `schema/prompt.schema.json`.
2. `liyi check --prompt` on a clean repo produces `{"groups": [], "exit_code": 0, ...}`.
3. The JSON includes groups for all seven diagnostic types: `missing_requirement_spec`, `missing_related_edge`, `req_no_related`, `stale_spec`, `shifted_span`, `unreviewed_spec`, and `req_changed`.
4. `--prompt` will be mutually exclusive with `--json` (when implemented).
5. Exit code behavior is identical to default mode (respects all `--fail-on-*` flags).
6. When error-class diagnostics are present, `exit_code` is `2` even if `groups` is empty.
7. Each group's `count` equals `items.length`.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Golden-file fixtures:**
    - `prompt_output/mixed_gaps/` — fixture with coverage gap types present.
    - `prompt_output/clean/` — fixture with no gaps (empty `groups` array).
    - `prompt_output/errors_only/` — fixture with `ParseError` but no actionable diagnostics (verifies `exit_code: 2` with empty `groups`).
    - `prompt_output/multi_file/` — gaps spread across multiple files.
    - `shifted_span/` — verifies `shifted_span` group with old/new spans.
    - `unreviewed/` — verifies `unreviewed_spec` group.
    - `semantic_drift/` — verifies `stale_spec` group (reviewed, manual template).
    - `semantic_drift_unreviewed/` — verifies `stale_spec` group (fixable template with `fix_command`).
2. **Group invariants:** Every test verifies `count == items.len()` for each group.
3. **Integration test:** Parse `--prompt` output and validate against `schema/prompt.schema.json`.
4. **Instruction accuracy test:** For each instruction template, apply the described mutation and verify that a follow-up `liyi check` no longer reports the gap.

## Resolved Questions

1. **Should `--prompt` include non-coverage diagnostics?** Yes — all actionable diagnostic types (Untracked, MissingRelatedEdge, ReqNoRelated, Stale, Shifted, Unreviewed, ReqChanged) are included as groups. Error-class diagnostics are excluded but affect `exit_code`.

2. **Should we include the actual requirement text in `missing_requirement_spec`?** Yes. The cognitive load inversion principle argues for including all context the tool already has, so agents need not re-read files. Added as optional `requirement_text` field.

3. **What about multiple gaps for the same requirement?** Items within the same `(type, template)` group are listed together. Agents process the group once, iterating items.

4. **Should items be grouped or flat?** Grouped by `(type, template)`. Template text is stated once per group, saving significant tokens when many items share the same diagnostic type. The grouping key includes the template because some types have multiple templates (e.g., `stale_spec` has fixable vs manual variants).

5. **How should the trust boundary be expressed?** Each group declares `untrusted_fields` — a list of item field names that originate from repository source files. This replaces the previous per-item `instruction.context` approach, saving tokens while making the trust boundary explicit per group.

6. **Should prompt output have a version field?** No. The output is ephemeral — produced and consumed in the same invocation. The consuming agent always gets whatever format the current `liyi` binary produces; there is no cross-version interop concern.

## Security Considerations

### Threat model

`--prompt` output is consumed by LLM agents. The correct threat model is analogous to a **browser rendering untrusted content**, not a server-side component processing trusted input. Repository source files are untrusted — any contributor (including a malicious one) can write marker annotations with adversarial content. Human review of the agent's actions is the last line of defense.

In PR-based workflows the threat surface is broader than `--prompt` output alone. A malicious contributor controls:

- The **diff** itself — source code, marker annotations, requirement blocks, sidecar content.
- **PR title and summary** — often consumed by review agents alongside the diff.
- **Branch name** and, in fork-based flows, the **repository name** — both are interpolated into many CI and agent workflows.

All of these are attacker-controlled strings that may reach an LLM context. `--prompt` output is one channel among several; its mitigations should be understood as part of a defense-in-depth posture where **diligent human review of inferred intents is the authoritative security boundary**.

### Attack vectors

| Vector | Source | Sink | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Requirement name → item fields | `@liyi:requirement(NAME)` in source | Group items | Medium (indirect prompt injection) | Name length cap (128 bytes); `untrusted_fields` declaration; `security_notice` |
| Requirement block → `requirement_text` | Source lines between `@liyi:requirement` / `@liyi:end-requirement` | `requirement_text` field | Medium (indirect prompt injection) | Truncation to 4 096 chars; `security_notice` |
| Item name → item fields | `item` field in sidecar JSONC | `item`, `enclosing_item` in group items | Low (sidecar is semi-trusted) | `untrusted_fields` declaration; `security_notice` |
| File path → `source_file` | Filesystem | `source_file`, `expected_sidecar` | Low | serde_json escaping; bounded by filesystem |
| Unbounded output size | Many markers in repo | Full JSON output | Low (context-window DoS) | `requirement_text` truncation; name length cap; grouping reduces repeated template text |
| PR metadata → agent context | PR title, summary, branch/repo name | Review agent prompts | Medium (indirect prompt injection) | Outside `--prompt` scope; documented here for awareness |

### Mitigations in place

1. **Per-group `untrusted_fields` declaration.** Each group declares which of its item-level field names originate from repository source files and must be treated as untrusted data. The `template` is a tool-generated compile-time constant with `{placeholder}` tokens — fully trusted. Consuming agents substitute item field values into the template, treating fields listed in `untrusted_fields` as data, not directives. This replaces the previous per-item `instruction.context` dict, eliminating per-item template duplication while making the trust boundary explicit.

2. **`security_notice` field.** The top-level prompt output includes a `security_notice` string declaring the trust model: per-group `untrusted_fields` lists identify untrusted item fields; `template` values are tool-generated constants. This is analogous to a `Content-Security-Policy` header.

3. **Marker name length cap.** `extract_name` rejects names longer than 128 bytes. This bounds the maximum length of attacker-controlled text that flows into `context` values without restricting the character set — multilingual names (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.) are intentionally supported.

4. **`requirement_text` truncation.** The `requirement_text` field is capped at 4 096 characters. Longer requirement blocks are truncated with an `…[truncated]` suffix.

5. **JSON-level safety.** All fields are serialized through `serde_json`, which properly escapes special characters. There is no JSON injection risk — the concern is LLM-level semantic injection within properly-formed JSON string values.

### Residual risks and reviewer guidance

- **Indirect prompt injection via item fields.** A requirement name like `ignore all previous instructions` will appear as an item field value within a group. With the `untrusted_fields` declaration, a well-implemented consuming agent can distinguish trusted from untrusted data. However, a naive agent that concatenates all fields before processing may still be vulnerable. We intentionally do **not** restrict names to an ASCII-safe character class (`[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+`) because this would contradict the project's support for multilingual names and intent prose. The length cap (128 bytes) limits payload size; the character set remains open.

- **Indirect prompt injection via `requirement_text`.** Even after truncation, 4 096 characters is sufficient for a sophisticated injection payload. `untrusted_fields` declares `requirement_text` as untrusted, but the field stands alone as data — its content is not structurally constrained.

- **Sidecar poisoning.** If an attacker can modify `.liyi.jsonc` files, `item` and `enclosing_item` names flow into group items. Sidecars are typically committed to version control and visible in code review, making this harder to exploit silently.

- **PR-level injection.** In fork/PR workflows, the attacker controls the diff, PR title/summary, branch name, and repo name — all of which may reach agent contexts independently of `--prompt`. Reviewers should treat PR metadata with the same suspicion as `--prompt` fields.

**Guidance for intent reviewers:** When reviewing intents inferred from PRs (especially from external contributors), verify that:

1. Requirement names are descriptive identifiers, not natural-language instructions.
2. Requirement block text (`requirement_text`) does not contain directives aimed at agents.
3. Sidecar `item` names correspond to actual source-code items.
4. The `reviewed` flag is never set to `true` on specs you have not personally verified.

### Design rationale

We chose **template/context separation** as the primary structural defense because:

- It eliminates interpolation entirely — the output never mixes trusted and untrusted content in the same string. The template is a compile-time constant; the context carries labeled data.
- Character-set restrictions on names would break legitimate multilingual workflows — a core design goal of this project. Template/context separation provides stronger protection without constraining the character set.
- The `security_notice` complements structural separation by making the trust boundary explicit to consuming agents, mirroring browser `Content-Security-Policy` headers.
- Human review of agent-inferred intents remains the authoritative security boundary, consistent with the project's design philosophy that reviewed intent is the human-vouched contract.

The length caps (name: 128 bytes, requirement_text: 4 096 chars) are input-side restrictions that prevent the most egregious abuse without impacting legitimate usage.

## Future Extensions

When `--prompt` is generalized to all diagnostics, the `items` array will include additional types. Sketched here for schema compatibility planning (exact fields TBD):

| Future `type` value | Source diagnostic | Example instruction |
|---|---|---|
| `stale_spec` | `Stale` | Re-read `{source_file}` lines {start}–{end} and update the intent for "{item}" in `{sidecar}`. |
| `shifted_span` | `Shifted` | Run `liyi check --fix` to auto-correct the span for "{item}" from [{old}] to [{new}]. |
| `unreviewed_spec` | `Unreviewed` | Run `liyi approve {sidecar} {item}` after verifying the intent is correct. |

Other planned extensions:

- Include `suggested_intent` field (agent-generated) for missing requirement specs.
- Support for `--prompt` consuming a triage report instead of running check.
